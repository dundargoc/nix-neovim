nix-neovim
==========

The goal of this project is to have a [NixOS][https://nixos.org]- and [home-manager][https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager]-like way to manage my neovim installation.
I will add stuff I use but it is completely extendible for everyone! You can easily use your own modules because I'm piggybacking off the NixOS module system.
